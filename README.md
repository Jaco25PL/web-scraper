# WEB SCRAPER

In this project, I will try to make a web scraper as simpler as posible in order to use it for future projects

In the `scraper.js` file we used the library **cheerio** to scrap by element, in the currect example we check for the class name

In the second file, `scraper-2.js` we used a simple tool, the **article-stractor** to scrap an article, passing it the html to scrap and get the info in a json file
